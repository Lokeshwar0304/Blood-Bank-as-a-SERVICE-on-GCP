# Blood-Bank-as-a-SERVICE-on-GCP

## Problem Statement:
The current method for handling blood donors, blood banks, hospitals, and recipients is inefficient and disjointed. It can be time-consuming at times. Since it is not a linked network, identifying and searching for blood groups and donors can take time for people who are in need of blood or have been in an accident. The general treatment entails the following steps: waiting for an ambulance, going to the hospital, performing blood tests, and looking for blood. This is a time-consuming and inefficient procedure. As per the survey, 5.25 million accidents are occurring per year and among them 4.12 million people are in need for emergency blood. Managing blood for all of them across the world is a huge problem. So, we want to leverage the cloud technologies and come up with an efficient linked network system that solves the above problem.
